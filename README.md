# Blender-PlaneImation-Demo
a bge example project for controlling different animations using logic bricks and planes

the sprite sheet included here is not mine and should not be used in any commercial project, learning only! you've been warned Lol

so I included 3 different examples of animation

#1 states that switch when a property reaches a certain number
#2 a constant cycling animation
#3 a simple 2d platformer player setup

move around with A,D, Left / Right Arrows, and jump with W and UP Arrow keys

have fun and I hope this helps you get started making 2d styled games in BGE
